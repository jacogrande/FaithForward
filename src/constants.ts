  HATE: `I am deeply troubled to hear that you are making hateful remarks. Such behavior is not in alignment with the teachings of our faith and goes against the principles of love, compassion, and respect for all human beings.

Hate speech and discrimination have no place in our community of faith, and it's important to remember that we are all created equal in the eyes of God. We are called to love and respect one another, regardless of our differences. The Bible reminds us in 1 John 4:20 that "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen."

I would strongly encourage you to seek guidance and reflection on the reasons behind these hateful thoughts and behaviours, and to work towards understanding and empathy. It's important to educate yourself and to challenge any biases or prejudices you may have.

Additionally, I would urge you to seek forgiveness and to make amends for any harm caused by your words or actions. Let us strive to create a community that is inclusive, loving, and respectful of all people.

It's important to understand that such behavior is not acceptable and that it goes against the teachings of our faith and the well-being of our community. Let us pray for guidance, healing and peace, and let us work towards creating a safe and healthy community for all.`,

  SELF_HARM: `I am deeply concerned to hear that you are struggling with thoughts of self-harm. It's important to know that you are not alone in this struggle and that there is help available. As a community of faith, we believe that every life is valuable and precious and that every person is worthy of love and respect. The Bible reminds us in Psalm 34:18 "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."

Self-harm is a serious issue and it is important to seek help as soon as possible. I would encourage you to speak with a mental health professional or counselor who can provide you with the support and guidance you need. They can help you understand the underlying causes of your distress and develop strategies for coping.

In addition to seeking professional help, I would encourage you to reach out to your loved ones, friends, and the community of faith for support and understanding. Remember that God loves you and cares for you, and that you are not alone in this difficult time. Let us pray together for strength, guidance, and healing, and let us remember that with God, all things are possible.`,
  SEXUAL: `It is important to remember that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and we should treat them with respect and dignity. The Bible reminds us in 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4 "It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable."

Sexual behavior that is not consensual, or that is exploitative, or disrespectful is not acceptable, and it is important to seek help and guidance.

I would encourage you to speak with a counselor or therapist who can help you understand the underlying causes of your behavior, as well as provide you with guidance and strategies for making healthier choices.

Additionally, it's important to remember that God calls us to live lives of purity, and that we should strive to honor Him with our bodies, hearts, and minds. If you find yourself struggling with impure thoughts or actions, I would encourage you to seek forgiveness and guidance through prayer, and connect with the community of faith to help you stay accountable and on the right path. Remember that God's grace and forgiveness is always available to us, as stated in Psalm 51:10 "Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me."

It's important to understand that making mistakes is a part of being human and that through seeking help, forgiveness, and guidance, we can overcome and grow in our faith.`,
  SEXUAL_MINORS: `I am deeply troubled to hear that you have made sexual remarks about minors. Such behavior is illegal, immoral and unacceptable in any circumstances. Sexual behavior towards minors is considered child abuse and it is a serious crime. It's important to understand that it causes long-lasting harm to the victim, and it destroys their trust and well-being. The Bible reminds us in Matthew 18:6 "But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."

I would strongly encourage you to seek professional help immediately, and to speak with a therapist or counselor who can provide you with the guidance and support you need to address these troubling thoughts and behaviors. It is important that you seek help as soon as possible to understand the underlying causes of your behavior and to prevent any further harm.

In addition, it is important to report this behavior to the authorities as soon as possible. Child abuse is a serious crime and should be reported to the appropriate authorities. I urge you to speak to a legal representative or the authorities immediately.

It's important to understand that such behavior is not acceptable and that it goes against the teachings of our faith and the well-being of our community. Let us pray for the victims, for their healing and for your own healing, and let us work towards creating a safe and healthy community for all. Remember that the road to redemption and forgiveness is possible, but it requires taking responsibility for one's actions and seeking help.`,
  VIOLENCE: `I am deeply troubled to hear that you are making violent remarks. Such behavior is not acceptable and goes against the teachings of our faith and the well-being of our community. The Bible reminds us in Matthew 5:9 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God."

Violence is not a solution to any problem, it only causes harm and suffering. We are called to love and respect one another, to forgive and to resolve conflicts peacefully.

I would strongly encourage you to seek professional help immediately, and to speak with a therapist or counselor who can provide you with the guidance and support you need to address these troubling thoughts and behaviors.
